Building we apps with React is not just about composing components together and making sure that the logic works correctly. That arguably is
the most important part, where at least it's the biggest reason for using React. But building React apps is also about styling those apps.
You wanna make sure that your application look good and styling is also an important part of building components. And there are different
techniques for setting styles dynamically and for styling components such that other components are not affected by a specific component's
styles.

In this module:
 - Conditional & Dynamic styles(how you can switch certain styles based on some conditions, for example, if a user enters an invalid input
then you want to color the input field red).

We will dive into two popular approaches for scoping styles to components:
For setting up styles such that they only affect the component and are not added as global styles.
 - Styled components, which is a third-party library, a very popular one, which allows us to set up pre-styled components with their own
scoped styles. And we'll have a look at a concept called CSS modules. And you will learn what these different approaches are all about
how you do work with them, and how you could add them to your next project.
